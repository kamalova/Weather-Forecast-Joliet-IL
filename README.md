###  Project Overview 
The goal of this project was to analyze historical weather data and develop an ML model to predict the weather for Joliet, IL in 2024. The project involved data acquisition, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

### Data Understanding
The initial dataset was composed of 7324 rows and 27 columns, offering a substantial amount of data for analysis. The dataset was thoroughly examined to comprehend its structure and the information it encompassed. Data cleaning techniques were employed to address missing values and inconsistencies. Through these measures, a cleaner  dataset was obtained, forming the basis for subsequent analysis and modeling endeavors.

### Model Analysis
A machine learning solution was developed using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The model utilized day, month, and year as input features and predicted the temperature as the target variable. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

### Conclusion
In this project, a simple ARIMA model was developed to predict the weather for Joliet, IL in 2024. The model achieved a moderate level of accuracy, marking the first step in weather prediction for the given location. The analysis provided valuable insights into historical weather patterns and served as a quick exploration of the dataset.

To further improve the accuracy of weather predictions, more comprehensive analysis and advanced machine learning models can be explored. By delving deeper into the data and applying advanced techniques, it is possible to achieve more accurate and reliable forecasts.
